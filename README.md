## Completed Tasks
 1. [X] Initiate DBConnection with JPA/Hibernate using Singleton Design Pattern; 
 2. [X] Building Business Entities hierarchies with JPA/Hibernate and then implement mapping between these entities;
 3. [X] Auxiliary classes with helper methods;
 4. [X] Class hierarchy for loading effect applied on starting the app and loading each menu/submenu, made with builder, factory and null object design patterns.
 5. [X] Custom message for header/logo with several different message styles: CLASSIC, MODERN, HACKER, ASCII ART;
 6. [X] Classes/interfaces that can deliver custom header with position, frame and styles designated for specific use;
 7. [X] Error classification along with severity defined in a standalone class hierarchy;
 8. [X] A separate class that delivers the loading bar and logo for when the app is started;
 9. [X] Custom printing of errors to console in a specific text frame;
10. [X] Following SOLID, DRY, YAGNI and KISS design principles;
11. [X] CPosition, HFrameWithContent, HMessage, Header Menu, AuxiliaryMessage and PrintMenu classes with associated methods along-with-builder and null object for each class;
12. [X] Logo/Loading progress bar, Login Page and Main Menu page completed;
13. [X] Various loading effects for moving forward, go back and quit;
14. [X] Using Command along with a Builder design pattern to create the menu hierarchy and interactions with this menu;
15. [X] Faceted builders were made for DB entities to clarify the construction of complex objects using fluent interfaces;
16. [X] A configuration file was made as an .yml along with a POJO which reflects that config loaded with a ReadConfiguration class made as a singleton with an inner static class inside it;
17. [X] Logging was implemented with Log4J2 framework, and we have a FileAppender with JSON layout. Logs are sent in /var/log/messages/email-adm.log.json. Now in case this log will reach 10MB or 10k lines, the log4j2 will rotate the log and a new file will be made. Logs are sent to /var/log/messages to be accessible after the jar file is generated. 
18. [X] To continueâ€¦interaction with the DB under development
